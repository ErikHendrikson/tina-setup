title: 'An unwanted nickname: Angel of Death'
---

Some people might think of the Grim Reaper. Some might think of Shinigami, gods of death in Japanese folklore and mythology, and seen in the famous anime Death Note. And some metalheads may read this title and be reminded of the Slayer song on their famous 1986 release ‘Reign in Blood’. The lyrics refer to one of those angels of death: Josef Mengele. Also known as the Auschwitz butcher, this person made it to the top of the list of the Angels of Death, and it’s easy to understand why. His experiments on identical twins, by which one of the twins serves as the subject and the other as the control, are considered as some of the most brutal in human history.

The Angel of Death, Azrael, is in Islamic culture responsible for taking the souls of the deceased away from the bodies, acting on Gods behalf. But through myth and legend Azrael is also considered to be a fallen angel, serving Satan himself. The title Angel of Death, given to certain historical figures, obviously refers to the second explanation.

Next to Josef Mengele another SS officer has also been named an Angel of Death. August Wilhelm Miete worked at the Grafeneck and Hadamar Euthanasia Centres. Less familiar than the ‘Final Solution’ (concerning the Jewish people), Aktion T4 was a secret Euthanasia Program in which August Miete became heavily involved. The goal was to exterminate individuals with disabilities and mental illnesses, who were considered to be ‘unworthy of life’ (lebensunwertes Leben). It can be seen as an extension of the German eugenetics movement, which had an extreme right wing even before nazism. Darwinism was interpreted by them as a justification. It’s clear that this is a misinterpretation of what Darwin meant, when he was talking about ‘survival of the fittest’, referring to the one being the most adaptable to change (On the origin of species).
The knowledge, infrastructure and personnel in this program were later used in the Holocaust. And it was by prisoners at Treblinka, which was the second-deadliest extermination camp in Poland during WWII that Miete got nicknamed the ‘Angel of Death’ by its prisoners. He would send prisoners who were too weak or sick to the Lazaret, where each person would be placed next to a burning pit and be shot to death. Miete would often be the one to shoot.

“When all the sick and wounded had been brought, it was my job to shoot them. I fired at the nape of the neck with a 9 mm pistol. Those shot would fall… into the pit… The number of people shot in this way from each transport varied. Sometimes two or three, and sometimes twenty or even more. They included men and women, young and old, and also children….” – August Miete

Another historical figure who made it to the list, and one who fascinates me deeply and was living in a very interesting time, is Louis Antoine de Saint-Just. A pretty boy, known for being good with the ladies.

“…the great republican historian Jules Michelet, described Saint-Just as ‘the archangel of death’, a phrase that encapsulated the legend of the unnaturally beautiful and cold-bloodedly terrible Saint-Just” – Marisa Linton ([https://www.historytoday.com/miscellanies/french-revolutions-angel-death](https://www.historytoday.com/miscellanies/french-revolutions-angel-death)) (excellent article!)

He was part of the Comite de Salut Public during the Terror in the French Revolution. Saint-Just was already a member of the National Convention and was elected as one of the 9 member of the Comite. Together with the famous Maximilian Robespierre and Georges Couthon he formed a triumvirate in the Comite. He held fierce pleads to ‘purify’ the society of elements that were contrarevolutionair.

“We must not only punish traitors, but all people who are not enthusiastic. There are only two kinds of citizens: the good and the bad. The Republic owes to the good its protection. To the bad it owes only death.“ – Louis Antoine de Saint-Just
