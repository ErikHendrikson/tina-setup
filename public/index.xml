      <description>Some people might think of the Grim Reaper. Some might think of Shinigami, gods of death in Japanese folklore and mythology, and seen in the famous anime Death Note. And some metalheads may read this title and be reminded of the Slayer song on their famous 1986 release ‘Reign in Blood’. The lyrics refer to one of those angels of death: Josef Mengele. Also known as the Auschwitz butcher, this person made it to the top of the list of the Angels of Death, and it’s easy to understand why.</description>
